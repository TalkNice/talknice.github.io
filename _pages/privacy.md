Thank you for using our app. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our iOS apps.

## Information We Do Not Collect

We do **not** collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII). This includes your name, email address, phone number, location, or any other information that could identify you.

## Usage Data

We may collect anonymous usage data to help us understand how the app is being used. This may include:

- Which features are used most frequently
- App crash reports
- General interaction patterns

This data is collected **in aggregate** and **cannot be linked** to any specific user. It is used solely to improve the performance, stability, and usability of the app.

We use any photos that you provide temporarily in generating an output image with AI. Your photos are NEVER stored or shared.

## AI-Generated Content

Our apps allows users to generate images using AI based on their input. We do **not** associate this input or the generated images with any personal data. We may retain user text inputs and generated images indefinitely to improve the app’s functionality or for internal research. They are not linked to any personal data.

## Data Selling

We do **not** sell your data to any third party.

## Third-Party Services

Our apps use third-party AI tools (such as OpenAI, Google, etc.) by securely sending input data to them in order to generate AI images. Our apps also may collect anonymized usage data using third-party tools to help us monitor and improve the app. These third-party tools operate under their own privacy policies and do **not** receive any personally identifiable information from us.

## Children's Privacy

Our apps do not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13. As no personal information is collected, the app complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

## California and Europe Residents

If you are located in California or the European Economic Area, you may have specific rights under the GDPR or CCPA. As we do not collect personal data, these rights are unlikely to apply, but we are committed to complying with applicable laws.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users through the app or on our website.
